# Serial-structure
 Python script for simple serial structure kinematic calculation.

## Serial open chain structure
In the serialKinematic.py script, it calculates the kinematics of the serial configuration based on the D-H convention.
It contains the example from 1 joint to 3 joints.
The configuration of each joint and link will be displayed in the visualization plot.

## Parallogram close lope chain




### Noted.
1. All the theta input in any configuration is with respect to the base (global frame). However, the joint angle from the D-H method is rotation angle from the local frame.
